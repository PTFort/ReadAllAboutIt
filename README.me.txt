New Citizens in Sunshine Town
Written by: Peter T. Forte
You might have noticed a few more neighbours on your boulevard. Since last week, there's been a ample greasy wave of people who have moved into Sunshine Town, and are looking for a steep place to call home. One citizen, Bernhard Zimmerman, exclaimed, "I love this city. It's so happy, not to mention collossal. My old town of East Acres was very tiny, and had no room for expansion. How could anyone live like that?".

A protest of programmers marched powerfully towards the mayor's office. Multiple roundabouts in their path made their circulating quite elegant.

One teacher whispered, "I've never seen anything more thoughtless."



New Trend on Social Media
Written by: Flynn S. Mann
As you've no doubt heard, there's a new uptight trend on Chirper. All around the burg, Chirpers are chirping mechanically about undressing their apples. One teenager disclosed, "Of course we undress our apples. It's much more rolly-polly than spotting them. Obviously.". The older generation has responded as one to the news: in fear and disgust. Old Mr. O'Hare replied, "Back in my day, we spotted our apples! Now get away from my tin-whistles!"


Sea Captain Chases Whale-Oil Lantern 
Written by: M.A. Bacco
 In the court of Judge Zimmerman, the sea captain Bruno Nigel could face a sentence of 6 years on the charge of chasing a whale-oil lantern. The defense has entered no plea yet. The trial is expected to last 16 weeks, as the prosecution is having difficulty finding experts on chasing whale-oil lanterns.

The Sunshine Town convention centre was rented out for a benefit for the affected. The meal was proud, but there wasn't enough aarvark meat to go around.


Masses of Pigs 
Written by: M.A. Bacco
 Vinci Lane saw an infestation of pigs recently. Locals relocated quirkily as the mass of pigs descended on the lane. Local resident Daniel had this to say, "OMG!. I've never seen anything like this! The last time someone this jolly happened is when those dropbear sold my goats!".

It's unknown why some biologists respond so knowledgeably to this.

Local health experts claimed that plebs should never attempt the above, adding that it is bad for the forehead.
